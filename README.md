# The Odin Project / tic-tac-toe
First ruby project recreating tic-tac-toe. Turn based and on the command-line. Meant to practice beginner principles of object-oriented design.
I wasn't proud of this one so I made it private but decided to make it visible again after I finished mastermind to show progression.
My apprach to checking the board isn't super efficient but this was my initial solution. I've seen people create a set of all possible wins and checking for that instead which is pretty brilliant.
